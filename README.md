CrowdFunding



Problem Statement:-

In contemporary crowdfunding platforms, issues regarding transparency, security, and efficiency persist due to centralized control and a lack of trust among participants. Traditional systems are vulnerable to fraudulent activities, lack of accountability, and high transaction fees. Moreover, geographical limitations and bureaucratic hurdles often hinder access to crowdfunding opportunities for individuals and organizations globally. In this context, there is a pressing need for a decentralized crowdfunding solution leveraging blockchain technology to address these challenges and revolutionize the crowdfunding landscape.
